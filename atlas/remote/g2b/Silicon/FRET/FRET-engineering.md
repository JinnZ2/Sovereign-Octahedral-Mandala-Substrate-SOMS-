## Overview

This framework treats FRET as an **information channel** with tunable capacity. The goal is to maximize mutual information I(X;Y) between photon absorption (input) and useful work output (sink excitation).

Three coupled control architectures stabilize the channel parameters:

1. **Geometry Lock** — Fix distance (r) and orientation (κ²)
1. **Spectral Servo** — Hold spectral overlap (J) at set-point
1. **Photonic Branching** — Suppress radiative loss (k_rad)

Optional fourth lever:
4. **Triplet Reservoir** — Recover non-radiative losses via rISC

-----

## When to Use This Framework

This engineering approach applies when:

- Working with **rigid scaffolds** (MOF, COF, DNA origami)
- Using **discrete donor-acceptor pairs** (not strongly coupled aggregates)
- Requiring **deterministic performance** with tight tolerances
- Building **thin-film devices** or precision architectures

If your system is self-assembled, defect-tolerant, and operates via coherent exciton transport, see the **Soliton Antenna** framework instead.

## Governing Equations

### Förster Rate and Efficiency

```
k_FRET = (1/τ_D) × (R_0/r)^6

E = 1 / (1 + (r/R_0)^6)

R_0 ∝ (κ² × Φ_D × J)^(1/6) × n^(-2/3)
```

Where:

- `r` = donor-acceptor distance
- `R_0` = Förster radius
- `κ²` = orientation factor (2/3 isotropic, up to 4 aligned)
- `Φ_D` = donor quantum yield
- `J` = spectral overlap integral
- `n` = refractive index

### Branching Fractions

```
f_FRET = k_FRET / (k_FRET + k_rad + k_nr)

f_rad = k_rad / (k_FRET + k_rad + k_nr)
```

### Observable Proxies

```
τ_DA^(-1) = k_FRET + k_rad + k_nr

r_ss = (I_∥ - I_⊥) / (I_∥ + 2×I_⊥)    [steady-state anisotropy]
```

## Architecture 1: Geometry Lock

**Goal:** Fix r and κ² to eliminate geometric uncertainty.

### Mechanism: Entropic Spring + Phononic Cage

- **Spacing control:** MOF/COF node holds acceptor; donor on bifurcated linker (rigid + soft segments)
- **Potential well:** U(r) = U_rigid(r) + U_entropic(r) with stiff minimum at r* ≈ 3.0 nm
- **Hard rails:** ~1.8 nm floor (avoid Dexter), ~5.0 nm ceiling (FRET collapse)
- **Orientation lock:** Crystalline lattice acts as phononic cage, suppressing sub-ns angular jitter

### Targets

|Parameter  |Specification            |
|-----------|-------------------------|
|Distance   |r = 3.0 ± 0.3 nm         |
|Orientation|⟨κ²⟩ ≥ 1.0 (goal 1.2–1.5)|
|Jitter     |σ_r ≲ 0.1 nm RMS         |
|Correlation|τ_rot/τ_D ≥ 5            |

### Failure Signatures

|Symptom                     |Cause                 |Remedy                       |
|----------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------|
|τ_DA↑, acceptor rise weakens|r drift upward        |Stiffen rigid linker fraction|
|r_ss↓, T-sensitive          |Phonon jitter returned|Increase local stiffness     |

-----

## Architecture 2: Adaptive Spectral Servo

**Goal:** Hold spectral overlap J at set-point despite thermal/aging drift.

### Mechanism: Witness Pixels + Stark Tuning

- **Sensing:** Isolated reporter FRET pairs (“witness pixels”) provide τ_DA(t), spectral centroid, r_ss(t)
- **Actuation:** Weak patterned E-field induces linear Stark shift
  
  ```
  ΔE = -Δμ · E  →  Δλ_D/A ~ 1–5 nm
  ```
- **Control law:** PI/PID with anti-windup
  
  ```
  e_J(t) = J* - Ĵ(t)
  E_field(t) = K_P × e_J + K_I × ∫e_J dt
  ```

### Targets

|Parameter       |Specification             |
|----------------|--------------------------|
|J stability     ||ΔJ/J*| ≤ 5% over envelope|
|τ_DA band       |τ* ± ε_τ                  |
|Servo saturation|None (headroom maintained)|

### Failure Signatures

|Symptom                |Cause               |Remedy                      |
|-----------------------|--------------------|----------------------------|
|Slow red-shift         |Aging               |Increase Stark bias         |
|Δr_ss during correction|Cross-coupling      |Reduce field gradient       |
|Integral windup        |Aging exceeded range|Recalibrate or expand tuning|

-----

## Architecture 3: Photonic Branching Control

**Goal:** Suppress k_rad so FRET dominates the rate competition.

### Mechanism: LDOS Suppression via DBR or 3D Photonic Crystal

- **Structure:** Dielectric Bragg Reflector (thin film) or inverse opal/woodpile (nanoparticles)
- **Tuning:** Stop-band aligned to donor emission λ_D
- **Effect:** Local density of optical states (LDOS) suppressed → k_rad reduced

```
k_rad' = F(λ_D) × k_rad    where 0 < F < 1 in stop-band

f_FRET' = k_FRET / (k_FRET + F×k_rad + k_nr)
```

### Targets

|Parameter         |Specification                   |
|------------------|--------------------------------|
|LDOS factor       |F ≤ 0.10 at λ_D                 |
|Radiative fraction|f_rad ≤ 0.15 (≤ 0.20 acceptable)|
|Acceptor band     |Off stop-band (unaffected)      |

### Failure Signatures

|Symptom          |Cause                    |Remedy                   |
|-----------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
|f_rad creeping up|DBR detuned (index drift)|Re-align stop-band to λ_D|

-----

## Architecture 4: Triplet Reservoir (Optional)

**Goal:** Recover energy that would be lost to k_nr by parking it in the triplet manifold.

### Mechanism: ISC → T_1 → rISC → S_1 → FRET

Population diverted to T_1 can return via reverse intersystem crossing (rISC), getting a second chance at FRET transfer.

### Kinetic Scheme

```
S_1 → A        (k_F, FRET)
S_1 → hν       (k_R, radiative)
S_1 → ∅        (k_nr,S, non-radiative)
S_1 → T_1      (k_ISC)
T_1 → S_1      (k_rISC = b)
T_1 → ∅        (k_nr,T + k_P = c)
```

### Effective FRET Fraction

```
f_FRET^eff = k_F / [k_F + k_R + (1-ρ)×k_nr,S + ρ×k_nr,S×(1 - b/(b+c))]
```

Where:

- `ρ` = fraction of k_nr,S diverted into ISC
- `b/(b+c)` = triplet return ratio

### Targets

|Parameter   |Specification      |
|------------|-------------------|
|Diversion   |ρ ≥ 0.6            |
|Return ratio|b/(b+c) ≥ 0.8      |
|Cascade lift|ΔE_cas ~ +0.07–0.13|

## Diagnostic Protocol: Triage Hierarchy

When the composite objective (I(X;Y) proxy) is violated, diagnose in strict order:

### Level 1: Geometry Check (r, κ²)

**Triggers:**

- τ_DA lengthens, acceptor rise weakens
- r_ss drops with temperature sensitivity
- Polarization signatures broaden

**Interpretation:** Structural failure (entropic spring / phononic cage compromised)

**Action:** Restore mechanical constraint. Do NOT adjust servo yet.

### Level 2: Rate Budget Check (f_rad)

**Triggers:**

- E_cas drops but geometry proxies stable
- Donor PL fraction increases

**Interpretation:** LDOS detune (DBR/PBG index drift)

**Action:** Re-align photonic bandgap to λ_D.

### Level 3: Servo Check (J)

**Triggers:**

- τ_DA in band, r_ss steady
- E-field duty or error integral saturates

**Interpretation:** Aging exceeded Stark tuning range

**Action:** Recalibrate or expand tuning span.

### Level 4: Reservoir Check (if implemented)

**Triggers:**

- All above stable but E_cas still low

**Interpretation:** Triplet losses (c) too high, or ρ too low

**Action:** Improve rISC pathway or reduce triplet quenching.

-----

## Fractal Scaling Path

For commercial viability, shift burden from expensive geometry control to cheaper rate control.

### Architecture: Dendrimer/Micelle Core-Shell

- **Structure:** Donors at periphery (absorption), acceptor/catalyst at core (funnel)
- **Geometry:** Statistical r ≈ 3 nm with slight σ_r increase
- **Trade:** Accept higher CV(τ_DA), plan for module replacement

### Compensating Nudges

- Raise R_0 by ~10–15% via ⟨κ²⟩ → 1.5 (shear alignment) and chemistry that increases J
- Enforce F ≤ 0.10 via 3D photonic crystal (inverse opal/woodpile)
- Optional: triplet reservoir for extra headroom

### Minimum Acceptable Lifetime

Bound CV(τ_DA) by 1.5% under drift:

```
Var(τ_DA)/τ_DA² ≈ Σ_x (∂ln(τ)/∂x)² × [σ_x,0² + (γ_x^eff × t)²] ≤ (0.015)²
```

Solve for first t that violates bound → τ_acceptable

If τ_acceptable < commercial target, increase rate headroom before tightening geometry.

-----

## Fractal Failure Modes

### Energy Tax

Spectral staircase burns ~0.32 eV for directionality. Ensure final emitter still has enough potential to drive the reaction.

### ACQ Trap

High-density outer shells form H-aggregates/excimers. Add steric bulk or rotaxane encapsulation.

### Impedance Mismatch

Antenna delivers faster than catalyst turns over. Add “bleed valve” sacrificial emitter or reduce antenna size.

### Updated Triage (Fractal)

1. **Red Edge Test:** Excite outer shell, check for broad red-shifted emission → ACQ
1. **Power Dependence:** Efficiency drops at high intensity → Core saturation
1. **Solvent Swelling:** Efficiency improves → Dyes too close; drops → FRET was working

## Summary

The engineering stack provides deterministic FRET control through:

- Geometry lock (r, κ²)
- Spectral servo (J)
- Photonic branching (k_rad)
- Optional triplet reservoir (k_nr)

Triage order: Geometry → Rate budget → Servo → Reservoir

Theorem 1: Phononic Cage Suppression of κ² Variance

Statement: For a donor–acceptor pair embedded in a crystalline lattice with a phonon bandgap at the rotational frequencies of the dyes, the root‑mean‑square fluctuation of the orientation factor satisfies

\frac{\sigma_{\kappa^2}}{\langle \kappa^2 \rangle} \le \frac{\hbar}{k_B T_{\text{eff}}}

where T_{\text{eff}} is the effective temperature of the rotational bath, determined by the phonon density of states inside the gap.

Derivation sketch:

· Model dye as rigid rotor in a harmonic angular potential created by the lattice.
· Rotational correlation time \tau_{\text{rot}} is proportional to \exp(E_{\text{barrier}}/k_B T) for a free rotor, but inside a phononic bandgap the spectral density of bath modes at the librational frequency is suppressed by an exponential factor.
· Use fluctuation–dissipation theorem to relate angular variance to the integrated bath spectrum.
· Result: \langle \delta \theta^2 \rangle is reduced, hence \langle \kappa^2 \rangle approaches its maximum value (4 for parallel dipoles) and variance shrinks.

Simulation hook: Use a Langevin equation for the dye orientation with a colored‑noise torque derived from a Debye‑type phonon density of states with a gap.

Theorem 2: Optimal Stark Shift for Servo Bandwidth

Statement: Given a spectral overlap integral J(\lambda) that depends on donor emission f_D(\lambda) and acceptor absorption \epsilon_A(\lambda), a small Stark shift \Delta \lambda yields a fractional change in J given by

\frac{\delta J}{J} = \frac{\Delta \lambda}{\lambda_0} \cdot S(\lambda_0)

where S(\lambda_0) is the logarithmic derivative of J at the set‑point. The maximum achievable correction bandwidth is

\Delta J_{\text{max}} = J \cdot \frac{\Delta \mu \cdot E_{\text{max}}}{k_B T} \cdot S

Derivation:

· Expand J = \int f_D(\lambda)\epsilon_A(\lambda)\, d\lambda under a rigid shift of both spectra (assume both donor and acceptor experience similar linear Stark effect).
· The shift magnitude is \Delta \lambda = \frac{\Delta \mu \cdot E}{hc} (ignoring polarizability term for simplicity).
· The first‑order fractional change is \frac{\delta J}{J} = \frac{\Delta \lambda}{J} \int f_D'(\lambda)\epsilon_A(\lambda) + f_D(\lambda)\epsilon_A'(\lambda) \, d\lambda. Integrating by parts yields the S factor.

Simulation hook: Compute J numerically for realistic dye spectra (e.g., from a database of fluorophore spectra) and determine S(\lambda_0) to inform the proportional gain K_P.

Theorem 3: Branching Ratio Improvement in a 1D Photonic Crystal

Statement: For a donor placed at the center of a dielectric defect layer within a DBR stack, the radiative decay rate modification factor F = k_{\text{rad}}' / k_{\text{rad}} is given by

F = 1 - \frac{\xi}{Q} \cdot \frac{\lambda_D / 2n}{d_{\text{defect}}}

where \xi is the overlap of the donor dipole with the cavity mode, Q is the cavity quality factor, and the fraction accounts for spatial confinement of the mode.

Derivation:

· Use Fermi's golden rule with the photonic local density of states (LDOS) modified by the cavity.
· For a weak cavity (mirror reflectivity R), the on‑resonance LDOS is enhanced by the Purcell factor F_p = \frac{3}{4\pi^2} \frac{Q}{V_{\text{eff}}} times orientation factor.
· However, for suppression, tune the donor emission to the stop‑band edge, where LDOS is reduced. A simple 1D transfer matrix model yields an expression for F that can be approximated as above.

Simulation hook: Use tmm (transfer matrix method) in Python to compute the exact LDOS for a given DBR stack and dipole position, outputting F as a function of wavelength and angle.

2. Master Equation for Simulations

A unified rate‑equation model that captures all four architectures is:

\begin{aligned}
\frac{d[S_1]}{dt} &= I_{\text{exc}}(t) - (k_F + k_R + k_{nr,S} + k_{\text{ISC}})[S_1] + k_{\text{rISC}}[T_1] \\
\frac{d[T_1]}{dt} &= k_{\text{ISC}}[S_1] - (k_{\text{rISC}} + k_{nr,T} + k_P)[T_1] \\
\frac{d[A]}{dt} &= k_F [S_1] - k_{\text{decay}}[A] \quad (\text{acceptor excited state})
\end{aligned}

where

· k_F = k_{\text{FRET}} = \frac{1}{\tau_D} \left(\frac{R_0}{r}\right)^6 with R_0 dependent on \kappa^2, \Phi_D, J, n.
· k_R = F \cdot k_{R,0} with F from photonic environment.
· k_{\text{ISC}}, k_{\text{rISC}} are triplet‑related.
· All rates can be time‑dependent if we implement the spectral servo (varying J) or geometry drift.

Observables:

· FRET efficiency: E = \frac{k_F}{k_F + k_R + k_{nr,S} + k_{\text{ISC}}(1 - \Phi_{\text{T}})} where \Phi_{\text{T}} = \frac{k_{\text{rISC}}}{k_{\text{rISC}}+k_{nr,T}+k_P}.
· Donor lifetime: \tau_{DA} = \frac{1}{k_F + k_R + k_{nr,S} + k_{\text{ISC}}(1-\Phi_{\text{T}})}.
